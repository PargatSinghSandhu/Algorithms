*if the root == NULL, then put the val in the TreeNode and retrun it. return new TreeNode(val);
1. Put the root into the new node.
2. start a while loop, while(true).
3. Now, check if the value(val) which is to be inserted is greater than the node value.
3. If yes it means that the val will be inserted in the right side of the binary tree.
4. Now, check if the right side of node is null or not.
5. If it is not null then, set the node= node->right.
6. If it is null then it means that the val will be inserted here and break the loop.
7. IF the val is less the node->val, then it means it will be inserted in the left side of the tree.
8. Now just check if the Node->left!=NULL, if it is not null then do node= node->left.(this will traverse to the next node).
9. if node's left val is null, then just put the value here, node->left = new TreeNode(val) and break.
10. return root;
