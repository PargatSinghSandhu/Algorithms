1. Put the root into the new node.
2. start a while loop, while(true).
3. Now, check if the value(val) which is to be inserted is greater than the node value.
3. If yes it means that the val will be inserted in the right side of the binary tree.
4. Now, check if the right side of node is null or not.
5. If it is not null then, set the node= node->right.
6. If it is null then it means that the val will be inserted here and break the loop.
