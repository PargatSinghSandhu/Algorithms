arr [] = {1,2,3,3,5,8,10,10,11} 
target = 1;
lower bound = arr[i]>=target 

1. Set 0th index as low and n-1 as high. 
2. Set Hypothetical answer of lower  bound = ans as n.(If we find the answer then that's good if not then the n will be the answer).
3. Now I've to check throughout the array but in binary so we run a loop until the high<=low.
4. Now we find a mid = (low+high)/2.
5. The moment we get mid we will compare with target. 
6. If the mid is greater than the target then we go to the left side and high = mid - 1.
7. If the mid is less than the target then we go to the righ side and low = mid + 1.
